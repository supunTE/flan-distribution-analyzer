Would you let me know what you think? I will be meeting with Mark H. tomorrow to talk with him about it. It isn't  clear to me who should receive this and from whom it should come. Since the  communications people may have relationships with some of these folks, is  Kristina the right person? I know that EES has some kind of joint venture  with AOL - should Vicki sign off? If it is going to such persons, should the  memo come from Mark? Cliff Baxter? John Sheriff? Jim Derrick?

She is nearly murdered by her father when he discovers her, as he does not recognize her as his daughter (being as he had never met her since infancy and because she is disguised as a young man). She survives when Mrs. Lovett screams in the basement bakehouse, distracting Todd and allowing her to escape.

A shotgun goes off as its owner unfastens its case at a N.C. gun show, wounding 3. 1 man shoots himself with his semi-automatic in Indiana, police say. All three shootings are deemed accidental by authorities.
Output: At least five people -- three in North Carolina, one in Indiana and one in Ohio -- were injured after weapons went off at gun shows Saturday, officials said, at a time when there's been renewed discussion about private gun sales at such shows. The most casualties came at the Dixie Gun and Knife Show in Raleigh, North Carolina, where attendees bolted -- with at least one woman wiping out in the frenetic scene -- when gunfire rang out around 1 p.m., as seen on video captured by CNN affiliate WRAL. Police later explained that a a 36-year-old man from Wilmington, North Carolina, was unfastening the case of his 12-gauge shotgun on a table near the show entrance when it accidentally discharged. The man planned to sell the shotgun at the show. The bird shot ended up injuring three people. One was a sheriff's deputy, who suffered a slight injury to his hand and was treated and released at a local hospital before returning immediately to work, said Joel Keith, chief of police of the North Carolina State Fair. A 54-year-old woman from Benson, North Carolina, was being treated for a wound to her right torso at a local hospital, and a 50-year-old man from Durham, North Carolina, was treated for an injured left hand, Keith told reporters. ""I want to emphasize that this is an accident,"" Keith said. That said, Wake County sheriff's investigators and the local prosecutor will determine whether to file charges against the gun's owner, authorities said. Read more: Surprise! Mom packed you a nice gun. Sheriff Donnie Harrison said he was unsure whether it was legal to bring a loaded gun on state fairgrounds. However, when the state fair is held in October, it is illegal to bring a loaded gun to the fairground because of the large crowds, authorities said. ""This is state property. That's something we're looking into,"" Harrison told reporters. ""It's early right now."" The shooting prompted police to ban any private gun sales -- in which visitors bring their firearms to sell at the gun show -- for the remainder of the two-day show, which concludes Sunday, Keith said. He added there wouldn't be any private gun sales on fairgrounds for the indefinite future. The gun show was closed after the shooting and will reopen Sunday. At that point, show vendors can continue to sell firearms, which are already secured inside the show, Keith said. ""If we thought if it was a problem or a hazard, we wouldn't have this show,"" Keith said about private gun sales at the show. ""I'm sure there isn't anybody who hates this more than the guy who owned this weapon."" Man shoots business partner with semi-automatic handgun. A person is in stable condition at a northern Ohio hospital after being shot by his business partner at a gun show run by Conrad and Dowdell Productions, said Medina police Chief Patrick Berarducci. The original owner of the Taurus semi-automatic 9 mm handgun used in the shooting brought the firearm into the show fully loaded. This is despite the policy of searches to make sure all guns are not loaded and rendered safe before others can handle them. The man who bought the gun told police that he took it out, then accidentally fired it, said Berarducci. A single bullet ended up going into the arm and thigh of this man's business partner. Authorities don't know who brought the loaded firearm into the gun show and sold it, added the police chief. They'll file a request with the federal ATF to track this person down. The victim, meanwhile, is in good spirits with non-life-threatening injuries, according to Berarducci. And in Indianapolis, a man walking out of the Indy 1500 Gun and Knife Show shot himself in the hand as he was loading his .45-caliber semi-automatic firearm, Indiana State Police said in a statement. The 54-year-old Indianapolis man was sent to Wishard Hospital for treatment after being ""slightly"" injured. ""The investigation determined the shooting to be accidental, and no charges will be filed,"" police said. Read more: Newspaper removes controversial online database of gun permit holders. Shootings occur as gun debate rages. Reforming private gun sales -- at shows or anywhere else -- is among the changes that President Barack Obama is now seeking by requiring background checks. The president has called for action in the wake of last month's shooting at a school in Newtown, Connecticut, which left 27 people -- 20 of them children age 7 or younger -- dead. Gun control activists have likewise pushed for changes, while gun rights advocates have said restrictions on gun sales are unnecessary and in defiance of their Second Amendment rights. Currently, federal law requires background checks on gun sales by federally licensed firearms dealers, who are often among the vendors at gun shows. Saturday's incidents occurred on 'Gun Appreciation Day,"" an event led by a gun rights group that urged Americans to ""go to your local gun store, gun range or gun show with your Constitution, American flags and your 'Hands off my Guns' sign to send a loud and clear message."" Sen. Charles Schumer, a New York Democrat, last Sunday issued a statement predicting this event would drive up sales of things like ""assault-style rifles,"" which have already ""skyrocketed"" in the wake of the Newtown mass shooting. Jabari Richards, a gun enthusiast, told WRAL at the Raleigh, North Carolina, show that he thought some reforms were wise. ""I think there should be background checks for everybody,"" Richards said, ""because then you know they ... are capable of having a gun."" But another man at the Raleigh show said it was useless for Washington to step in. ""The gun laws that they have on the books aren't enforced, don't do any good,"" Al Galbraith said.

Scientists say this risk is increased among certain groups - including white women with a healthy body mass index (BMI). Researchers at the University of Chicago analysed 1,642,824 mammograms, which included 9,300 breast cancer cases, from menopausal women. Data on HRT use was analysed by ethnicity, age, BMI and breast density for the Journal of the National Cancer Institute study. Results showed there was a 20 per cent increased risk of breast cancer associated with HRT use among white and Hispanic women, but not black women. HRT use was more strongly associated with breast cancer risk in women with low or normal BMI, but no link was found among those with a high BMI. Women with denser breasts also had an increased chance of breast cancer while using HRT. The researchers found a significant relationship between breast density and HRT independent of BMI. HRT use was not associated with breast cancer for women with high BMI and low breast density, whereas HRT use was associated with a significantly higher risk of disease for women with low or normal BMI and high breast density. The researchers say the results show HRT may be used for some women without increasing breast cancer risk. There is a 20 per cent increased risk of breast cancer associated with HRT use among white and Hispanic women, but not black women. Image shows breast cancer cells. Lead author Dr Ningqui Hou said: ‘Black women, obese women, and women with breast tissue composed largely of fat may benefit from HRT use with minimal excess breast cancer risk. ‘Further studies to confirm these findings and provide more information on other modifiable risk factors for breast cancer in relation to HRT use are needed.’ Dr Mary Beth Terry, from the Department of Epidemiology and the Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Centre at Columbia University, said: ‘Ultimately, efforts that improve risk stratification, whether made through improved risk models or through measuring valid intermediate biomarkers such as breast density, will inform appropriate use of not only HRT, but also other medications, including chemopreventive drugs.’

",White and Hispanic women are at greater risk than black women are. Women with dense breasts are also more likely to develop breast cancer. Findings suggest that some women could take HRT without experiencing an increased risk of breast cancer.,8,Flan2021,cnn_dailymail:3.4.0,fs_noopt

""Lassiter, will you be my rider?"" Jane had asked him. 

""I reckon so,"" he had replied. 

Few as the words were, Jane knew how infinitely much they implied. She wanted him to take charge of her cattle and horse and ranges, and save them if that were possible. Yet, though she could not have spoken aloud all she meant, she was perfectly honest with herself. Whatever the price to be paid, she must keep Lassiter close to her; she must shield from him the man who had led Milly Erne to Cottonwoods. In her fear she so controlled her mind that she did not whisper this Mormon's name to her own soul, she did not even think it. Besides, beyond this thing she regarded as a sacred obligation thrust upon her, was the need of a helper, of a friend, of a champion in this critical time. If she could rule this gun-man, as Venters had called him, if she could even keep him from shedding blood, what strategy to play his flame and his presence against the game of oppression her churchmen were waging against her? Never would she forget the effect on Tull and his men when Venters shouted Lassiter's name. If she could not wholly control Lassiter, then what she could do might put off the fatal day. 

One of her safe racers was a dark bay, and she called him Bells because of the way he struck his iron shoes on the stones. When Jerd led out this slender, beautifully built horse Lassiter suddenly became all eyes. A rider's love of a thoroughbred shone in them. Round and round Bells he walked, plainly weakening all the time in his determination not to take one of Jane's favorite racers.

Problem: Vermont () is a state in the New England region of the northeastern United States. It borders the other U.S. states of Massachusetts to the south, New Hampshire to the east, New York to the west, and the Canadian province of Quebec to the north. Lake Champlain forms half of Vermont's western border with the state of New York and the Green Mountains run north-south the length of the state. 

Vermont is the second-least populous of the U.S. states, ahead of Wyoming, and the the sixth smallest by area. The state capital is Montpelier, the least populous state capital in the U.S. The most populous city, Burlington, is the least populous city in the U.S. to be the most populous city in a state. As of 2015, Vermont was the leading producer of maple syrup in the United States. It was ranked as the safest state in the country in 2016. 

For thousands of years indigenous peoples, including the Mohawk and the Algonquian-speaking Abenaki, occupied much of the territory that is now Vermont and was later claimed by France's colony of New France. France ceded the territory to Great Britain after being defeated in 1763 in the Seven Years' War. For many years, the nearby colonies, especially the provinces of New Hampshire and New York, disputed control of the area (then called the New Hampshire Grants). Settlers who held land titles granted by New York were opposed by the Green Mountain Boys militia, which supported the many settlers whose claims were based on grants from New Hampshire.

Problem: Once upon a time, there was a cowgirl named Clementine. Orange was her favorite color. Her favorite food was the strawberry. She really liked her Blackberry phone, which allowed her to call her friends and family when out on the range. One day Clementine thought she needed a new pair of boots, so she went to the mall. Before Clementine went inside the mall, she smoked a cigarette. Then she got a new pair of boots. She couldn't choose between brown and red. Finally she chose red, which the seller really liked.

input: Abidjan, Ivory Coast (CNN) -- Three top allies of Ivory Coast's former president, Laurent Gbagbo, have been arrested in less than a week, raising political tension in the West African nation, where the nation's army has been hit by weeks of attacks. 

Laurent Akoun, general secretary of the Front Populaire Ivoirien, Ivory Coast's former ruling party, was arrested on Sunday in Adzope, 100 kilometers east of Abidjan, the nation's economic capital and most populous city, party officials said. 

Akoun was arrested for having defamed President Alassane Ouattara during a recent meeting with some of the party's members and supporters in an Abidjan cafe, said Sylvain Miaka Oureto, the party's leader. He also is accused of harming state security because of what he said during the meeting, Oureto said. 

He said Akoun was still in custody Monday evening. 

Akoun, the current deputy chief of the party, was heading to a party rally when the nation's gendarmerie -- a paramilitary force -- arrested him and transferred him to Abidjan, said Augustin Guehoun, the head of communication for the party. 

His arrest follows that of two former Gbagbo Cabinet ministers, one of them in Ghana, where he had sought refuge. 

Oureto said the series of arrests against the party's high-ranking officials is intended to ""behead the Front Populaire Ivoirien."" He said the government is ""man hunting"" against the leaders of the party. 

At least seven attacks have been carried out since August 5 by unidentified gunmen against the Forces Republicaines de CÃ´te d'Ivoire, Ivory Coast's national army. At least 17 people were killed in the attacks, including 10 Ivorian soldiers.  1. Who is Ivory Coast's former president?

input: François-Marie Arouet (; 21 November 1694 – 30 May 1778), known by his ""nom de plume"" Voltaire, was a French Enlightenment writer, historian, and philosopher famous for his wit, his attacks on the established Catholic Church, and his advocacy of freedom of religion, freedom of speech, and separation of church and state. 

Voltaire was a versatile and prolific writer, producing works in almost every literary form, including plays, poems, novels, essays, and historical and scientific works. He wrote more than 20,000 letters and more than 2,000 books and pamphlets. He was an outspoken advocate of civil liberties, despite the risk this placed him in under the strict censorship laws of the time. As a satirical polemicist, he frequently made use of his works to criticize intolerance, religious dogma, and the French institutions of his day. 

François-Marie Arouet was born in Paris, the youngest of the five children of François Arouet (19 August 1649 – 1 January 1722), a lawyer who was a minor treasury official, and his wife, Marie Marguerite Daumard (c. 1660 – 13 July 1701), whose family was on the lowest rank of the French nobility. Some speculation surrounds Voltaire's date of birth, because he claimed he was born on 20 February 1694 as the illegitimate son of a nobleman, Guérin de Rochebrune or Roquebrune. Two of his older brothers—Armand-François and Robert—died in infancy and his surviving brother, Armand, and sister Marguerite-Catherine were nine and seven years older, respectively. Nicknamed 'Zozo' by his family, Voltaire was baptized on 22 November 1694, with , and Marie Daumard, the wife of his mother's cousin, standing as godparents. He was educated by the Jesuits at the Collège Louis-le-Grand (1704–1711), where he was taught Latin, theology, and rhetoric; later in life he became fluent in Italian, Spanish, and English. 1.

In the first quarter, Cincinnati pounced first with RB Rudi Johnson getting a 5-yard TD run for the only score of the period.  In the second quarter, the Titans answered with kicker Rob Bironas getting a 28-yard field goal.  Fortunately, the Bengals responded with QB Carson Palmer completing a 10-yard TD pass to WR Chad Johnson.  Tennessee would end the half with Bironas nailing a 23-yard field goal. In the third quarter, Cincinnati began to pull away as RB Kenny Watson managed to get a 6-yard TD run, while Palmer hooked up with Chad Johnson on a 2-yard TD pass.  In the fourth quarter, the Bengals sealed the victory with Palmer hooking up with Chad for the third time on a 3-yard TD pass. Chad Johnson (12 receptions for 103 yards and 3 touchdowns) ended the game as the Bengals' All-Time receptions leader with 531.  Also, this marked the third time in his career that he caught 3 touchdown passes in one game.

Problem: This week marked the return of former Eagles head coach Andy Reid. The Eagles forced the Chiefs to a quick three-and-out, but the Eagles miffed the punt, and the Chiefs recovered at the Philadelphia 8. A few plays later, Ryan Succop kicked a 33-yard field goal. On Philadelphia's first possession, Michael Vick was intercepted by Eric Berry, on a pass intended for Brent Celek, who returned it 38 yards for a touchdown. After a Chiefs punt, Michael Vick busted off a 61-yard run, setting up his 22-yard touchdown pass to Jason Avant. Zach Ertz attempted to run in the 2 pt. conversion, but failed, keeping the score 10-6. With less than a minute remaining in the first quarter the Eagles drove into Chiefs territory, but Vick was sacked by Justin Houston and fumbled. Two field goals by Ryan Succop was the only scoring of the second quarter, giving the Chiefs a 16-6 halftime lead. An Alex Henery field goal was the only score of the third quarter, giving the Chiefs a 16-9 lead entering the fourth quarter. On their first drive of the fourth quarter, Jamaal Charles capped off a 8 play, 62 yard drive with a 3-yard touchdown run, making the score 23-9. The Eagles immediately responded with a touchdown of their own, driving 78 yards with a 41-yard touchdown rush by LeSean McCoy, pulling to within 7. However, Kansas City struck the decisive blow with a 15 play, 73 yard drive, taking 8:15 off the clock and Ryan Succop adding his fourth field goals making the score 26-16. On their next drive, Michael Vick completed a 19-yard pass on 3rd-and-10, but guard Todd Herremans was called for holding making it 3rd-and-20 at their own 21. The Eagles turned the ball over on downs. The Chiefs did the same on their next drive. Finally, a strip sack by Justin Houston with recovering for Kansas City, sealed the deal. With the loss, the Eagles lost their second in a row, both being at home. The Eagles out gained Chiefs 431-394 and had more first downs, 21-19, but the Chiefs dominated TOP 39:07 to 20:53 and won the turnover battle 5-0.

Q: The years between the Easter Rising of 1916 and the beginning of the War of Independence in 1919 were not bloodless. Thomas Ashe, one of the Volunteer leaders imprisoned for his role in the 1916 rebellion, died on hunger strike, after attempted force-feeding in 1917. In 1918, during disturbances arising out of the anti-conscription campaign, six civilians died in confrontations with the police and British Army and over 1,000 were arrested. Armistice Day was marked by severe rioting in Dublin, which left over 100 British soldiers injured. There were also raids for arms by the Volunteers, at least one shooting of a Royal Irish Constabulary  policeman and the burning of an RIC barracks in Kerry. In Co. Cork, four rifles were seized from the Eyeries barracks in March 1918 and men from the barracks were beaten that August. In early July 1918, Volunteers ambushed two RIC men who had been stationed to stop a feis being held on the road between Ballingeary and Ballyvourney in the first armed attack on the RIC since the Easter Rising - one was shot in the neck, the other beaten, and police carbines and ammunition were seized. Patrols in Bantry and Ballyvourney were badly beaten in September and October. The attacks brought a British military presence from the summer of 1918, which only briefly quelled the violence, and an increase in police raids. However, there was as yet no co-ordinated armed campaign against British forces or RIC.
What happened first: Thomas Ashe dying of hunger strike or volunteers ambushed two RIC men?
A: Thomas Ashe dying of hunger strike

The Redskins would then close out the second quarter with cornerback DeAngelo Hall returning a fumble 25 yards for a touchdown. The Cowboys would get on the board in the third quarter as quarterback Tony Romo found wide receiver Miles Austin on a 4-yard touchdown pass.  Washington would respond in the fourth quarter as Gano nailed a 49-yard field goal.  Afterwards, Dallas appeared to have won the game as Romo completed a 13-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Roy Williams, but a holding call on offensive tackle Alex Barron preserved the Redskins victory.
How long was the longest field goal?
A: 49-yard

Q: The Mongolian Revolution of 1921  was a military and political event by which Mongolian revolutionaries, with the assistance of the Soviet Red Army, expelled Russian White Guards from the country, and founded the Mongolian People's Republic in 1924. Although nominally independent, the Mongolian People's Republic was a satellite state of the Soviet Union until 1990. The revolution also ended Chinese occupation over Mongolia, which had existed since 1919. Official Mongolian name of the revolution is ""People's Revolution of 1921"" or simply ""People's Revolution"" .

gem/wiki_lingua_english_en:1.1.0,110270,"INPUT ARTICLE: Article: There is little to no scientifically-backed support for most homemade treatments; support for these methods is mostly anecdotal, or based on personal accounts. These treatments may or may not work, and could potentially damage your skin. Talk to your doctor before attempting any homemade treatment.  If you have particularly sensitive skin take extra care and use more diluted versions of these solutions. Stop if any of these irritate your skin. It is thought that a proteins found in eggs may kill bacteria that causes acne. To make a face mask, separate an egg white from the yolk and, after patting dry your face, apply the egg white to your skin. You can use a cloth for this, if you use your fingers make sure they are clean and dry first. Once the first egg layer has dried, add another. Repeat this 3-5 times, always letting each layer dry first. Then wash it off and pat dry.  You can add a layer of tissue between each egg layer. Peel each layer off before you wash your face at the end.  Raw egg whites can grow salmonella. Be sure not to ingest raw egg white. Honey has both antiseptic and anti-bacterial properties and may assist in healing wounds and skin infections. There is, however, no evidence that it has any affect on blackheads or acne. It is thought the stickiness may help it bind to the blackheads and remove them.  Warm up some honey in a pan, or place a jar of honey in hot water. When the honey is hot to the touch, but there is no danger of you burning yourself, dab it onto your blackheads and let it dry for around ten minutes. Wash off your face with a damp cloth.  You can leave this treatment on overnight, but make sure it has dried or you might wake up with your face stuck to your pillow!

SUMMARY: Understand the limitations and risks of homemade treatments. Try an egg white mask. Use warmed honey.


INPUT ARTICLE: Article: What are your long-term goals? Think about where you see yourself in ten years. Do you want to be a home owner? Do you want to be running the company you work at now? Do you want to be married with some kids? Consider whether or not you are moving in the right direction to achieve your long term goals. If not, you will need to identify some areas for change. Sometimes change is so big and so scary that you don't want to contemplate it at all. But you can do something about that, and you can do it right now. Grab a piece of paper and a pen. Brainstorm and write out your answers to the following questions as quickly as you can. Don’t get hung up on grammar, spelling, or punctuation, just write.  What's working well in my life right now? List some of the positives about your life as it is right now. To make a change, you need to be aware of what you like as much as you're aware of what you don't like so that you don't end up wrecking the positives in your life. You can also list some of your strengths here so that you know what you have to draw on as you go through the change process. What are the areas of my life I want to change? Do you hate your job? Are you in an unhappy marriage? Write down the parts of your life that are making you really unhappy. Pick out the top 3 to 5 things you'd like to change. Again, quickly and without too much thinking, write down the steps that you can take to make changes. Do not overwork this––there is plenty of time for fine adjustment later. You've just created a quick, personal road map for change. Over time, you can refine this road map, For now, you've broken down those large and looming ""it's all too hard to change"" feelings and turned them into some concrete steps. Read through what you have written to solidify them in your mind and start working towards these goals. Having a large goal like “become a millionaire” is great as a long term goal, but it does not give you concrete items to work on. To achieve a goal, you need to break it into smaller, more realistic goals. For example, you could break your large goal of becoming a millionaire into something more manageable like “set up a savings account” or “ask for a raise.” These are items that will help to move you closer to your goal and make it seem more manageable.  Transform general statements into something more active. For example, instead of writing something generic like ""find my passion,"" pick something actionable and specific. You can instead say, ""visit a career coach"" or ""take an aptitude test."" Turn big projects into small to-dos. For instance, instead of writing ""find a new job,"" break it down into steps like ""update my resume,"" ""create a LinkedIn profile,"" ""research new companies"" or ""write a letter of resignation."" After you have reviewed your list of items, figure out what you can easily accomplish in the next 48 hours and do it. Perform as many of these small action steps as you can within the next 48 hours to put yourself on the road to change. Here are some examples:  To get out of an unhappy relationship: Talk to your partner, line up a new place to stay, pack your belongings, or ask friends to help you move. To make yourself more healthy: Throw out all of the junk food in your cabinets, join a gym, talk to people who will support you, or get some new sneakers. To move to a new city: Find an apartment in the new place, list your current house or condo for sale, start throwing away things you don't want to take with you, or call your friends and relatives to tell them the news.

SUMMARY: Think about your long-term goals. Figure out what you'd like to change. Read everything that you've written. Break larger objectives on your list up into smaller actionable items. Do something to move towards your goal.


INPUT ARTICLE: Article: When photographers shoot photos in an unflattering exposure setting, the lighting and contrast may look washed out. Determine whether the exposure makes the subject seem faded out or muddled. Recommend a different exposure setting if so. Suggest that the photographer experiment with aperture or shutter speed if the exposure seems off. Study it for unintentional blurriness. After evaluating potential camera errors, analyze the photo's subject. Is the focal point ideal for the picture, or could the artist have chosen a different angle? Offer advice for the photographer if the focus is obscured or misguided. Landscape photos often look best in sharp focus. Soft backgrounds with a focal point on the subject works well in portrait photography. Focal length involves how close or far away the subject seems, or how close together the subjects seem. If the photo seems squished together or excessively spaced apart, the focal length might not complement the photo. Offer suggestions to retake the photo with various focal lengths. Unwanted dust or lens glare can ruin an otherwise well-taken photo. Recommend that the photographer clean their lens or pay more attention to light sources. A sentence or two about either should suffice, with the majority of the critique focused on more overarching elements.

gem/wiki_lingua_english_en:1.1.0,175934,"Hedging is when you second guess your authority by saying things like “I think,” “In my opinion,” “seems like” “kind of” and other wishy-washy statements. Hedging makes you seem less authoritative and less confident. Try to leave hedges out of your presentation, especially your opening. Instead, make bold authoritative statements in your introduction to show them that you are trustworthy. Asking questions that you are going to answer right after or that are not really worthy of debate will also lead your audience to believe that you lack authority. It’s okay to ask a meaningful question or two during the opening to your presentation, just don’t overdo it. Keep questions thoughtful and to a minimum. Raising your voice at the end of a question is similar to asking a question. This simple change in pitch may lead your audience to conclude that you are uncertain about the claims that you are making. Instead of raising your voice at the end of your sentences, lower it at the end of your sentences. Lower your voice at the end of a sentence makes you seem more authoritative and confident.

Summary: Leave hedges out of your presentation. Ask questions that matter. Lower your voice at the end of sentences.


Remember, you will be working on this for a very long time, so the dissertation topic needs to be something that you find interesting and engaging. Your topic will also need to be complex enough to justify a book-length analysis. Your thesis for the topic must be a significant contribution to scholarship in your field, so try to avoid topics that are well-covered already. It also needs to be something that you feel capable to prove and support.  You’ll need a topic that fits into the context of other work already done in your field of study. In some cases, you may need to explore different fields in order to find the right context for your work. Use your years of coursework and immersion in the field to come up with questions, concerns, or issues that consistently pique your interest. As you narrow down your list of potential topics, ask yourself things like: “What can I contribute that existing scholarship has not?”; “Is this topic too big (or small) in scope for a dissertation?”; “Am I ready to dedicate years of my life to this topic?” Your adviser will be your guide along this perilous journey, so make sure that you understand them and can work with them. Being unable to communicate complex ideas with this person will make it very difficult to proceed. You should both have a thorough understanding of what you’re trying to do and what your advisor expects from you.   Choosing the right advisor can go a long way toward making your dissertation process a success. Think carefully about how you fit, not only in terms of research interests, but in personalities. Take your advisor’s guidance to heart as you narrow your general topic into a clear focus. However, keep in mind that this is your dissertation, so be willing and able to state and defend your case. Think carefully as you assemble your committee. Know what their areas of expertise are, as well as areas where their knowledge is less robust. This will influence how you write your dissertation. Also consider what types of research and evidence they value highly, as well as any particular methods or interpretations that they treat with more skepticism. Don’t ignore your committee members until it’s time to submit a draft. Draw on their experience and knowledge as you fine-tune your topic, develop your thesis, and conduct research. Remember, they’re part of your team! Generally speaking, it’s best to go into your research process with an idea of what you want your thesis to be, but to let the research itself guide you into your thesis statement. No matter how much you already think you know about a topic, the substantial, in-depth research required for a dissertation will reveal many surprises and challenges.  Let your research guide you to your thesis, instead of trying to force the research to fit your thesis. Treat researching, writing, and revising a dissertation as individual tasks. Don’t try to start writing when you’ve only done part of your research, or you’ll have trouble juggling the different tasks and may have to make major changes to your thesis along the way.

Summary: Develop an initial idea for your topic. Work with your advisor to fine-tune your topic. Keep your committee in mind as you develop your strategy. Formulate your thesis as you conduct research.


The handles, if you added them, will be on the bench. You want the other long edge (12-1/2"") facing upwards. Lay 4-5 of the slats on top and adjust the ends so that they are the right distance away. The ends of the slats should be flush with the outside edges of the end pieces. This will make up the bottom of your crate. Start with the slat closest to the end so that you're making the corner of the box first. The glue is there to help you get the slat in position and keep it in place as you hammer. You'll need nails to make the crate sturdy. Thin, 1"" brad nails work well. Two in each end of each slat should do it. If you don't want to use nails, a thin screw or heavy-duty wood glue may also work. Add a little glue, adhere the slat, then nail it in. Start with the other end to make the other corner, then work inward. You should have five slats total on the bottom of the crate. Use your last eight slats to finish the crate up. Turn it on its side and attach four slats to each side, spacing them however you'd like. When you're done, let the wood-glue dry overnight. If you want a professional looking crate, get some stain out or paint the sides. You could use a wood burning kit to etch a design in as well. No matter how you choose to decorate your crate, make sure you wait a day for the glue to dry and the crate to settle before proceeding.

","Summary: Turn the ends upside down so that they are resting on their top edge. Place a line of wood glue on each end of the slat and attach it to the ends.

Article:
A: The Peak District National Park Authority hopes more people will be inspired to visit the park after experiencing the landscape online.
National park volunteers recorded 360 degree images by using Google Trekker equipment - a backpack fitted with a cluster of 15 camera lenses.
Filming took place over the summer.
Jim Dixon, chief executive of the Peak District National Park, said: ""It is our ambition that, by being on Google Street View, more people will enjoy the wonders of this protected and special landscape.
""Once people see it, I am sure they will be inspired to come and stay for a few days to explore first-hand what they have experienced online.""
Google Street View previously only allowed people to view the Peak District from roads.
However, the Trekker equipment is designed to capture locations the Street View car and tricycle cannot reach.
It was deemed impractical to film ""every inch"" of the 555 sq mile (1,440 sq km) park, so highlights were selected.
These include North Lees, the Monsal Trail, Tissington Trail and High Peak Trail.
The Peak District became the UK's first national park in 1951, and Google said making it virtually accessible was in the park's ""true pioneering spirit"".
Previous locations captured by the Trekker technology include the Grand Canyon and the Taj Mahal.

The four-time champion did about 40 laps at Ferrari's Fiorano test track before Thursday's accident. Pirelli said he ""simply lost control"".
Vettel could give no further details of what happened, but said: ""All good. I have no injuries or ailments.""
The car, a 2015 model modified to simulate 2017 downforce levels, was too damaged to continue with the test.
That meant the plan for Ferrari reserve driver Antonio Giovinazzi to have his first taste of an F1 car on Friday had to be called off.
The Pirelli spokesman said the company was evaluating potential technologies aimed at the 2018 season, including new tread patterns and rubber compounds.
Vettel's crash was on his first lap out of the pits after a break for lunch. The weather was cold - the temperature was 4C - and it has been suggested that a lack of temperature in the tyres could well have been a contributing factor.
F1 tyres have to be at the right temperature to operate effectively and the temperature in Maranello on Thursday was in the region of 10C cooler than F1 cars would ever normally encounter at even the coolest Grand Prix.
The Pirelli spokesman also said that one of the technologies the company was trying that day were tyres that operate without the use of the heating blankets that have been used in F1 for many years to ensure they are at close to operating temperature as possible when they leave the pits.
Pirelli has modified its wet-weather tyres for the 2017 season in response to widespread criticism from drivers of the 'extreme' tyre, which is used in the worst conditions.
Vettel described the tyre at last year's British Grand Prix as ""basically just good enough to follow the safety car"", adding that ""no-one really has any trust in it"".
The issue arose again following a number of crashes during the soaking race in Brazil in November.
The problems have led to F1 giving Pirelli more test days to try out tyre developments. One of the eight pre-season test days in Barcelona at the end of this month and the beginning of March has been dedicated to this.

Sum: Ferrari have been forced to cancel a Pirelli wet-weather tyre test following a heavy crash by Sebastian Vettel.

The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) said registrations rose year-on-year by more than 8.6% to just over 50,000 units.
That compared with an increase of just under 8.4% for the rest of the UK.
March is typically a strong month for car registrations, as it is when new number plates are released.
Business sales north of the border leapt by more than 50% last month, while fleet registrations were up about 13% on March last year.
However, private buyer registrations fell year-on-year by about 2.2%.
SMMT said sales were in part boosted by planned changes to Vehicle Excise Duty (VED).
New VED rates came into force on 1 April, making all new cars - apart for those with zero emissions - subject to an annual flat rate charge.
According to RAC research, most drivers buying new cars will pay significantly more following the changes.
Source: Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders
Scottish Motor Trade Association (SMTA) chief executive Sandy Burgess said: ""There is no doubting the new Vehicle Excise Duties coming in on 1 April would have been a major contributor to the registrations growth, which is most welcome.
""However, we should not lose sight of the fact that the private market has actually dropped within a retail marketing period that should have been stronger, as buyers would be seeking to save the additional costs associated with their new vehicles purchased post 31 March.""
March's top seller in Scotland was the Vauxhall Corsa, followed by Ford's Fiesta and Focus models.
Dumfries and Galloway, Fife, Highlands and Lothian all recorded a fall in registrations, while the rest of Scotland recorded growth.
The largest growth was recorded in Strathclyde, where sales rose by 16.3% to 3,820 units.

IN: Review: Lee Chang-dong's exceptional ""Secret Sunshine"" is the single most emotionally ravaging experience of the year. It is an instantly sobering, brutally honest character piece on the reverberations of loss and a graceful memento mori that resonates with a striking density of thought, yet remains as inscrutable as the emotions it observes. Through its layered naturalism and stunningly trenchant view of small-town dynamics, Lee implicitly deconstructs the traditional Korean melodrama by pulling apart the cinematics of excess and ripping to shreds the arcs that shape its characters and grounds the proceedings into a crushing grind of stoic realism.

""Secret Sunshine"" remains an immensely compelling, fluid work throughout its 142-minute runtime. Its bravura first hour is filled to the brim with subtextual insinuations, remarkable foreshadowing and adroit reversals of tone brought about by humanistic capriciousness. Adapted from a short story, Lee infuses the film with his sensitivity for the sublime paradoxes of life, last seen in his transgressively comic and irreverent ""Oasis"". Understanding how personal revolutions are forged when views of our universe are changed, Lee not only sees the emotional cataclysm of a widow's sorrow through an inquiring scope but also feels the tumultuous existential currents that underpin the film when religion becomes a narrative scapegoat in comprehending the heinousness of the human experience.

Do-yeon Jeon's (""You Are My Sunshine"") Best Actress accolade at Cannes in 2007 is well deserved. Her performance as the widow Shin-ae remains an unrelenting enigma. As a character pulled apart by forces beyond her control, the sheer magnificence of this performance is central to the film's turbulent nature. With Jeon essaying one cyclonic upheaval after another, there's a tremulous sense of collapse that the film, to its credit, never approaches. Instead it finds a delicate balance that saps the charged theatricality and subsequent banality from ordinary tragedies and its fallouts. She becomes the centre of the film's universe as well as ours. Filmed in glorious hand-held CinemaScope, the film demolishes the cinematicism of frames and compositions by becoming visually acute just as it is quietly harrowing when the camera never relinquishes its gaze from Shin-ae through times of happiness, guilt and remorse.

Lee captures the details of life in the small, suspicious town of Miryang  the awkwardness of communal situations, its uncomfortable silences and its devastations spun out of personal dramas. Shin-ae's interactions with the townsfolk rarely inspires dividends, especially when they are merely done out of obligation to fit in for the sake of her son, Jun (Seon Jung-yeop). The one recurring acquaintance is Jong-chan (Song Kang-ho), a bachelor mechanic of uncertain intentions who helps her en route to Miryang in the film's enchanting open sequence set to a captivating stream of sunlight. Song has situated himself as a comedic anti-hero in South Korea's biggest films but his nuanced, low-key delivery here purports the director's thought process of never having to reveal more than plainly necessary.

If pain is ephemeral, then grief can never truly dissipate. And Lee finds complexity in subsistence. When Shin-ae attempts to head down the path of reconciliation only to be faced again with unimaginable heartbreak, she unsuccessfully employs the fellowship of evangelical Christianity as a foil to her sorrow. But Lee knows better than that when he understands that religion, in the context of the human canvas of strife and misery, is never a simple solution. But Lee never rebukes the essence of religion as he realises the value of salvation for some through a higher power even if it serves a form of denial in others. The scenes in its latter half which deal with religion doesn't allow itself to become aggressively scornful, which is a feat in itself considering how many filmmakers let the momentum of the material take over from what they need to say to be true to its story and characters.

Lee's first film since his call to office as his country's Minister of Culture and Tourism is an uncompromising dissertation on human suffering. In a film so artless and genuine, it arduously reveals that there's nothing as simple as emotional catharsis, just the suppression and abatement of agony. ""Secret Sunshine"" leaves us with tender mercies pulled out of evanescence, and points towards a profound understanding of despair and faith.

imdb_reviews/plain_text:1.0.0,67394,"Q: Before seeing this movie, I was expecting a fictional drama based loosely on ideas from the book; instead, it's the book, interrupted with dramatic scenes illustrating the different ""illnesses."" That didn't bother me much, but it hindered my enjoyment of the film. One story or even two or three long stories with excerpts from the book interspersed through the movie would have been preferable, in my opinion. If you're going to base a movie on a psychology text, you've got to find a more interesting (and preferably accurate) text than this one. The film drags during parts where it's little more than a video encyclopedia of 19th century sexual psychology and would be utterly intolerable if it weren't sexual in nature (because ""sex = interesting"" for most of us, even me). Luckily, there are several stories with actual character development that pull us in.

But, disappointingly, Krafft-Ebing's theories of sexuality went unchallenged, for the most part. I was hoping it would use stories to show how the imperfections of his archaic view of psychology which is still held by many to this day.

So, in the end, what do you have? A detailed catalog of a few fetishes and orientations, with some mildly interesting stories showing the trials and tribulations of a few ""sexual deviants"" before they are cured. For most of the film, the film moves with the crawling speed (and mood) of a wake. And, as an obviously low budget film, the cinematography and acting are not exactly top tier. Although I *was* pleased with the music, costume and interior design.

I felt this film's subject was right up my alley, and I still feel it's a below average film. It deserves a 3/10; a 4/10 if I were feeling extremely generous. I can't imagine anyone enjoying this if they didn't already have an interest in sexual fetishism.

Q: Hollywood's attempt to turn Jack London's life into a ""Jack London"" adventure film isn't a bad idea; certainly, he led an interesting, and sometimes adventurous, life. This film, however, winds up flat and unsatisfying. Most importantly, it lacks integrity. Michael O'Shea (as London) has some Londonesque speeches; and, it's nice to see his bearded Jack receive ""The Call of the Wild"" after spending some quality time alone, in the snowy mountains, with his dog, ""Buck"". Virginia Mayo and Susan Hayward are both very pretty. The film draws unfortunate ""Yellow Peril"" parallels between London's life and World War II, which are both strained and insulting.

Q: The Shining starts with Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson) driving to an isolated hotel named the 'Overlook' situated high in the Colorado mountains for an interview with it's manager Stuart Ullman (Barry Nelson) about becoming the Winter caretaker. Ullman tells Jack that he will be responsible for the basic upkeep of the hotel but will be almost totally isolated from the rest of the world for six months as the harsh Winter sets in. Together with his wife Wendy (Shelley Duvall) & young son Danny (Danny Lloyd) Jack moves into the hotel & at first everything seems fine, it's a beautiful hotel, absolutely huge & whatever they need is at their disposal. However the Overlook hotel has a murky past with a previous caretaker murdering his entire family before committing suicide & Danny has the ability to 'shine' which means he has psychic powers that let him see & hear things 'ordinary' people can't. As the days, weeks & months begin to pass Jack become more & more insane, Danny keeps 'seeing' things & people while Wendy becomes frantic as she doesn't have a clue what's happening to her family, as a heavy snowstorm leaves them trapped Jack finally loses it...

This English production was co-written, co-produced & directed by Stanley Kubrick & is a fine horror film. It appears that The Shining is another film that exists in two distinct different versions & the one I will be commenting on is the shorter European cut that runs just under 2 hours in length. The script by Kubrick & Diane Johnson, is based on the novel by Stephen King which I have not read so I can't compare them, goes for psychological horror rather than visual with only one murder during the entire film. There are very few character's in The Shining with Jack, Wendy & Danny the only ones that really matter, since the film concentrates on them almost exclusively you care for them, become involved with them & what they go through. The pace is somewhat slow but this is one film that didn't feel that long & keeps you interested throughout. On the negative side I don't think the reasoning behind Jack going crazy & wanting to kill his family was strong enough to convince me, the fact that Jack escapes from the freezer without any explanation bugs me & I don't know if I missed something but that ending didn't make any sense to me whatsoever, I'm still trying to work out what that picture is all about! There is very little in the way of violence or gore, a couple of rotten zombie ghosts & someone is killed with an axe but The Shining is a horror film that doesn't need to rely on blood & special effects as it has a gripping story. With a budget of about $19,000,000 The Shining is technically flawless as you would expect from an obsessive filmmaker such as Kubrick, the cinematography is brilliant with some fantastic free-flowing & smooth steadicam shots as the camera effortlessly follows the character's around the maze of corridors, the sets look absolutely real & instead of clichéd old haunted house themes like dark corners, basements & cobwebs Kubrick brings things right up-to-date with brightly lit corridors, massive open expansive spaces & a modern decor (well 80's modern, just check that red toilet out!). The acting is good from everyone involved although as usual in horror films the little kid is highly annoying & Nicholson seems crazy from the very start. The Shining is an absorbing film that I enjoyed watching although I'm not sure I'd watch it again anytime soon. For those looking for explosions & fancy special effects you will be disappointed, for those looking for a good haunted house type horror with a strong story I definitely think The Shining is for you, well worth a watch in my humble opinion.

Q: I have read the book and I must say that this movie stays true to form. I think this is the beginning of the psychological thrillers in the same genre of Psycho. Cristina Raines gives an excellent performance as the lead, and Burgess Meredith gives an excellent supporting actor as the next-door neighbor. I have seen this movie at least twice and I think that I am going to buy both the book and the movie for my collection. The suspense just keeps building up to the climatic end, the twist you will never see coming. If you like movies like Signs and The Village, the Sentinel will be a classic prelude. Also, what is interesting is the actors in the movie-you would not recognize them if you did not read the credits. The late Jerry Orbach is great as the commercial director and Jeff Goldblum is excellent as the photographer. Also there is Beverly D'Angelo, who is underrated but great.

multi_news:1.0.0,84807,"– After barely surviving a confidence vote last month, Silvio Berlusconi may be poised to step down as Italy’s prime minister as soon as today, at least according to two journalists. ""That Silvio Berlusconi is about to resign is clear. It is a question of hours, some say of minutes,"" says an editor with close ties to the PM. But the PM himself denied the chatter on Facebook, writing, ""Rumors of my resignation are baseless,"" reports Reuters. Meanwhile, other insiders tell the Wall Street Journal that Berlusconi will meet with his family and the head of Italy’s top TV broadcaster today to make a decision. Alternatively, he could head to Parliament tomorrow to face a budget vote. But the vote could prove his majority is a thing of the past, and members of his crumbling party are encouraging him to resign, Businessweek notes. Three former allies have left his coalition since last week, with a dozen more poised to head for the door. ""Berlusconi may still be in office, but he has not been in power for some time,"" says an analyst. ""He no longer administers."" Markets jumped on the news of the PM’s possible exit.
Let's expand this into a news article: ROME (Reuters) - Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi defied huge pressure to resign on Monday, desperately playing his last cards to save his crumbling government as fears over Italy's instability hit markets across Europe. 
  
 Berlusconi denied reports by journalists close to him that he would resign within hours, immediately reversing a brief recovery in stock and government bond markets battered by political uncertainty in the euro zone's third economy. 
  
 Yields on Italy's 10-year bonds hit 6.67 percent, their highest level since 1997, at one point on Monday, close to the 7 percent level seen as unsustainable for Italy's huge debt, one of the world's highest. European stocks were also hit by the turmoil. 
  
 The movements indicated how much markets saw Berlusconi's departure as the only way to reduce the pressure on Italian bonds which has fueled a revolt in his party, although there is deep uncertainty about what would follow if he stepped down. 
  
 Government bond prices would recover and the yield spreads would narrow by a full percentage point if the government should fall, according to a Reuters survey of 10 fund managers last week. 
  
 Political sources said a late Sunday meeting of leaders of Berlusconi's PDL party had urged him to resign because of a major party revolt but he was still not convinced. However a confidence motion is likely this week in parliament. 
  
 Government minister Gianfranco Rotondi said on Monday he was optimistic the parliamentary majority would hold. Otherwise Italy would have to go to the polls, he said after meeting Berlusconi. 
  
 The prospect of early elections, opposed by many PDL deputies including rebels, is one of the last cards left to Berlusconi. He said those who brought down the government at a time of national peril would be traitors who would make economic reforms more difficult. 
  
 The 75-year-old media magnate and his closest aides spent the weekend trying to win back the support of enough deputies to avoid humiliating defeat on Tuesday in a crunch vote to confirm a state financing bill which he has already lost once. 
  
 Chances of defeat in this vote seem to be receding although if he did lose it, Berlusconi could either resign immediately or be ordered by President Giorgio Napolitano to call a confidence vote. 
  
 The center-left opposition may abstain in the Tuesday vote to expose Berlusconi's lack of support without torpedoing an essential measure. 
  
 NO CONFIDENCE MOTION 
  
 But the opposition is preparing a subsequent no-confidence motion that would likely be held within days. 
  
 Otherwise Berlusconi faces a confidence vote he has called himself in the Senate around November 18 on new measures promised to impatient European leaders to boost Italy's chronically stagnant growth and cut its debt. 
  
 Despite Berlusconi's unflinching defiance, many of those around him believe his days are numbered and that he has no chance of implementing unpopular austerity measures with an extremely fragile majority. La Stampa daily on Monday described the death throes of his government as a ""prolonged agony."" 
  
 Interior Minister Roberto Maroni, a senior member of Berlusconi's coalition ally the Northern League, said the writing seemed to be on the wall. 
  
 ""The latest news leads me to think that the majority no longer exists and that it is useless (for Berlusconi) to be obstinate,"" Maroni said. 
  
 However, even if he goes, the prospects for a way out of Italy's crisis remain obscure. Berlusconi and the Northern League insist the only alternative to him is an election early next year -- which would likely push back reforms even further. 
  
 The idea of a national unity or technocrat government, favored by markets, the opposition and probably the head of state, is opposed by Berlusconi and League leaders whose parliamentary support may well be necessary for it to function. 
  
 Newspapers have estimated the number of potential party defectors at between 20 and 40, which would be more than enough to topple the government. 
  
 Berlusconi has been meeting and telephoning rebels since he returned from a humiliating G20 summit in France on Friday in which he had to agree to IMF monitoring of Italy's progress in reforms he has long promised but so far not implemented. 
  
 Italy has the third biggest economy in the euro zone and its political turmoil and debt worries are seen as a huge threat in the wider crisis facing the continent's single currency.

 ROME—Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi on Monday was in 11th-hour talks aimed at saving his conservative coalition as investors renewed pressure on the premier to step down and allow a new government to steer the country out of Europe's debt crisis. 
  
 Over his 18 years as the leading man of Italian politics, the 75-year-old Mr. Berlusconi has survived sex scandals and corruption trials. But on Tuesday, Italy's controversial leader faces what is likely to be the biggest test of his political career: a parliamentary vote that could strip him of his governing majority, triggering a chain of events that could lead ... |||||

– Two people have been confirmed dead after a tornado struck a campground in Cape Charles, Va., WTKR reports. At least 20 more were injured in what the Virginian-Pilot describes as ""a fast moving storm that blew across the Eastern Shore this morning, toppling trees, injuring campers and blowing over RVs."" Three hospitals are currently prepping for mass casualties, according to USA Today. ""Several children have been injured at the campground. I don't know how many, but they have called for several ambulances to go there,"" a member of the Eastville Volunteer Fire Company in Cape Charles tells the paper. ""Debris was flying down the street—our chairs, beach balls. We lost power,"" a woman who lives across from the campground tells the AP. The woman also reported large hail. Check out WTKR for a live blog of incident as it unfolds.

 A couple from New Jersey died when a tree hit their tent at the Cherrystone Family Camping and RV Resort, and their 13-year-old son has life-threatening injuries. 
  
 Lord N. Balatbat and Lolibeth E. Ortega, both 38, died at the scene, according to a Virginia State Police spokeswoman. Their son was in another tent and was taken to Children's Hospital of The King's Daughters in Norfolk with serious injuries. Two others were also taken to CHKD. 
  
 The couple's two daughters were not hurt and were with family members who were also visiting the Eastern Shore campsite, said Corinne Geller, Virginia State Police spokeswoman, 
  
 The National Weather Service in Wakefield has confirmed that an EF-1 tornado hit and that its damage appears to have been limited to the campground site, Geller said. The tornado hit between 8:30 and 8:40 a.m., coming in from the Chesapeake Bay and entering the campground from the southwestern shore. The tornado then moved northwest through the campground, turned south and continued southeast through the campground. 
  
 There were 1,328 visitors and 40 staffers at the campground when the fast-moving storm blew across the Eastern Shore this morning, toppling trees, injuring campers and blowing over RVs with gusty winds, heavy rains and hail. Everyone who was at the campground this morning has been accounted for, Geller said. 
  
 At Riverside Shore Memorial Hospital, two children were admitted and one person was in surgery shortly after noon, said spokesman Peter Glagola. 
  
 State Police said 31 people were taken to Riverside and that most had been treated and released. One person was taken to Sentara Norfolk General Hospital, and another was flown to VCU Medical Center in Richmond. 
  
 Sentara Virginia Beach General, Norfolk General and Leigh hospitals all activated their mass casualty plans after receiving reports of multiple injuries, according to an email from a company spokesman. One child was taken to Virginia Beach General and later transferred to CHKD. Two other people went to Norfolk General. 
  
 Lt. Gov. Ralph Northam, a physician, was at CHKD this morning helping with the storm response, his office said in a statement. He pledged to help officials ""make sure that the Eastern Shore has the resources it needs to respond and recover from this horrible tragedy."" 
  
 Emergency crews were scheduled to remain at the scene overnight to continue cleaning up, according to state police.

 Angela Rivera was in a camper with her family and dog when the thunder started. 
  
 The sound was so loud, it felt like it was coming up from the ground instead of above them. About 20 seconds later, golf-ball-size hail began to fall and the wind howled. 
  
 ""We knew something was very wrong,"" she said. 
  
 During the next two minutes, the wind and rain didn't let up. The hail grew to the size of baseballs. She could hear screaming. Despite the storm still going on, men ran toward a tent a couple of streets away that had a tree on top of it. 
  
 ""They were trying to lift the tree. They were trying so hard, but they just couldn't do it,"" Rivera said. ""It was the most horrible thing I've ever seen."" 
  
 ""All hell broke loose,"" Joe Colony, who has been coming to Cherrystone campground along the Chesapeake Bay for 30 years, told The Associated Press. ""We got an emergency message on a cellphone and within 30 seconds, the thing hit and it blew down 40, 50 trees in the park."" 
  
 Gov. Terry McAuliffe canceled the remainder of his schedule in California and Colorado and is returning to the commonwealth on the next available flight. He will visit the Eastern Shore on Friday to survey the damage and meet with people affected. 
  
 The storm moved across Northampton County from the Chesapeake Bay around the time a tornado warning was issued. The warning had been prompted by a radar signature that indicated a water spout was moving eastward from the Chesapeake Bay. 
  
 A tractor-trailer driver was taken to a hospital with minor injuries after his rig blew over in the 2400 block of Lankford Hwy. in Northampton County. Virginia State Police were called to the scene about 8:45 a.m. The driver told police he was driving south on U.S. 13 when he saw the funnel cloud and then his truck was knocked over. 
  
 Troopers who went to the campground in Cheriton saw trees and power lines down and RVs that had been overturned. 
  
 Even after the storm, quarter-size hail was strewn across U.S. 13. The road was blocked at Townfield Road. 
  
 Police, sheriff's deputies and firefighters from around the area were at the scene and were continuing to search for injured people. The courthouse in Eastville closed for the day so that workers could go to the scene to help. Emergency plans there also had been activated. 
  
 Virginia Beach Emergency Medical Services sent six ambulances and a mass casualty truck to assist. 
  
 Glagola said Riverside also sent trauma surgeons and other medical personnel to the Eastern Shore from Newport News. 
  
 Northampton County declared a state of emergency, effective this morning, according to the county administrator's office. 
  
 Northampton High School was set up as a temporary shelter by the Virginia Department of Social Services, and 256 uninjured people were taken there, State Police said. Others were able to drive their own vehicles to the school. Four Northampton County Public Schools buses transported people from the Cherrystone campground, said Melinda Phillips, a media relations representative for the school system. 
  
 As trees and power lines have been cleared, visitors have been able to return to their campsites to collect their belongings. Nobody will be allowed back into the campground overnight, and the Red Cross is assisting displaced people. 
  
 The Virginia Department of Transportation said it was working to clear four roads that were blocked as a result of the storms. Downed trees or other hazardous road conditions may be reported by calling VDOT Customer Service at 1-800-367-ROAD (1-800-367-7623).

 Christi Hensler was one of those at the shelter. She said her 4-year-old daughter, Arianna, jumped in bed with her when the storm came through the campground. They played the game of counting between thunder and lightning to ease the girl's fears. She turned to her husband. 
  
 ""I'm not even getting to a second between,"" she told him. 
  
 Then the hail came down hard. Pine cones rattled against the windows and roof. The ground looked like it was shaking. 
  
 ""We didn't know if it was because of the hail or trees falling behind us,"" she said. 
  
 Ashley McAlister and her family watched the storm roll in this morning from a campground cottage. Trees snapped, pine cones fell in droves. McAlister heard people screaming. 
  
 ""We've been through hurricanes and lightning storms. This was nothing like anything we've ever seen,"" she said. 
  
 Campground workers told the Virginia Department of Emergency Management that about 1,300 people were at the facility when the storm hit. Some are residents, but most were visiting campers. 
  
 The campground has an array of amenities, according to its website, including an arcade, fishing piers, swimming pools, charter fishing, sunset bay cruises, cottages and a range of activities.

 CAPE CHARLES, Va. — A New Jersey couple has died and their son is critically injured after a tornado touched down Thursday in an Eastern Shore campground, Virginia officials said. 
  
 Three dozen people were injured and transported to area hospitals, Corrine Gellar, a Virginia State Police spokeswoman, said in a press conference outside Cherrystone Family Camping & RV Resort. More than 1,300 vacationers and staff were at the campground when the storm hit; all have been accounted for. The town of Cape Charles, just south of the campground, has about the same number of year-round residents. 
  
 Lord Balatbat and his wife, Lolabeth Ortega, both 38 of Jersey City, N.J., were killed when a tree fell on their tent, Gellar said. Their 13-year-old son, who was in a nearby tent, has life-threatening injuries. 
  
 The area around the campground where the twister touched down was under a tornado warning at the time, according to the National Weather Service. Weather service radar had shown a waterspout over Chesapeake Bay a little before 9 a.m. ET that prompted the alert. 
  
 ""It came in real quick,"" said Brittney Eder of the Eastville Volunteer Fire Co. here. ""The sky turned jet black.""

 Hospitals about 45 miles across the bay in Virginia Beach and Norfolk, Va., are caring for three of the most seriously injured victims, officials said. 
  
 Twenty-six patients are being treated at Riverside Shore Memorial Hospital on the Eastern Shore in Nassawadox, Va. Most of those storm victims have broken bones, lacerations and cuts, spokesman Peter Glagola said. 
  
 The tornado also caused a truck to overturn north of Cape Charles along U.S. 13 in nearby Cheriton, Va., The driver was transported to a hospital with minor injuries, Geller said. 
  
 Immediately afterward, U.S. 13 was littered with debris and hail that ranged from the size of a quarter to a golfball, witnesses said. Heavy rain accompanied the storm.

 The Northampton County Board of Supervisors declared a local state of emergency later Thursday morning, shutting down regular county government functions to concentrate on storm recovery, said Janice Williams, assistant to the county administrator. With about 12,000 population, it is among the smallest of Virginia's 93 counties.

It sits 300 acres along the Chesapeake about 15 miles from the southern tip of the Eastern Shore that divides the bay from the Atlantic Ocean.

multi_news:1.0.0,42864,"– Gunmen in Mexico have raided and set fire to a printing plant in the fourth attack on Monterrey-area media facilities in the space of weeks. The plant was used to print and distribute magazines, including leading news magazine Proceso, which reports extensively on the country's drug war and has had several of its journalists murdered, reports the AP. Nobody was injured in the latest attack, and the fire was put out relatively quickly. Over the weekend, gunmen stormed a Monterrey branch office of the newspaper El Norte and set it on fire. Experts believe the cartels are trying to silence the few remaining outlets that report on the drug war and on official corruption. ""There are parts of the country where criminal groups decide what gets published and what doesn't,"" a media expert at Mexico City's Ibero-American University tells al-Jazeera. ""They're trying to extend the pressure.""
Let's expand this into a news article: A newspaper in the Mexican city of Monterrey has come under attack, after several armed men stormed into a branch office of the El Norte newspaper, poured gasoline and then set fire to the building. 
  
 The attack on Sunday was the third such assault to occur in the last month. 
  
 More than 15 people were working at the office in the municipality of San Pedro Garza Garcia at the time of the attack. No one was injured, the newspaper reported. 
  
 Firemen who were called to the scene quickly extinguished the fire. 
  
 ""Some videos of the incident that we have in our possession show three vehicles in the headquarters located in San Pedro Avenue of the San Pedro Municipality where three people get out with a barrel of gasoline and enter the reception area and proceed to spill gasoline and light it,"" said Jorge Domene, a public security spokesperson. 
  
 ""Fortunately there were no injuries [...] and the fire was controlled quickly. Now we have some data on the vehicles and the people,"" he said. 
  
 Policemen and soldiers inspected the scene to find clues in order to begin an investigation. 
  
 Sierra Madre, the office which was attacked, published a weekly supplement covering the parties and social events of local residents. 
  
 On July 10, assailants fired assault rifles and grenades at two other El Norte office in Monterrey. 
  
 Pressure from cartels 
  
 Experts say the attacks could be a sign of an escalation in efforts by drug traffickers to intimidate one of the few regional outlets that continues to cover the drug war and investigate official corruption linked to cartels, while others fall silent to intimidation. 
  
 ""There are parts of the country where criminal groups decide what gets published and what doesn't,"" said Jose Carreno, a media expert at Mexico City's Ibero-American University. 
  
 ""They're trying to extend the pressure."" 
  
 El Norte is owned by Reforma, one of Mexico's biggest newspaper chains. 
  
 More than 80 Mexican journalists have been murdered since 2000, according to the National Human Rights Commission, with many of those killed reporting on crime and police. 
  
 Vowing to bring to justice the culprits behind the brazen crime, the governor of Nuevo Leon state, Rodrigo Medina, said authorities will not tolerate any attacks that curtail freedom of expression and media in the drug-ravaged state. 
  
 ""We cannot allow an attack such as this on the media, whatever form of media. We cannot provoke fear for freedom of expression and freedom of the media in this case. We will get to the bottom of this to find those responsible and behind it,"" said Medina. 
  
 Journalists under fire 
  
 Last year, Mexico was the third deadliest country in the world for journalists after Pakistan and Iraq, according to Reporters Without Borders. 
  
 There have been more than 55,000 drug related killings and more than 6,000 disappearances during President Felipe Calderon's six-year offensive against the cartels. 
  
 President-elect Enrique Pena Nieto, who will replace Calderon in December, promises to dramatically reduce the homicide rate. 
  
 Several press freedom groups urged Mexican authorities on Monday to investigate the latest attacks. 
  
 ""There is no journalist in Mexico who can feel safe when there are criminal groups who feel they can attack a national media outlet without any consequences,"" said Carlos Lauria, senior programme coordinator for the Americas for the New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists. 
  
 The federal Interior Department also issued a statement condemning the attack and said it has offered to help state authorities with the investigation. ||||| A gang of armed men has raided and set fire to a printing plant in northern Mexico used to print and distribute magazines. 
  
 It is the second attack in less than a week against media facilities in the northern Mexico border state of Nuevo Leon. 
  
 An official in the Nuevo Leon state prosecutors' office who was not authorized to speak on the record says the attack targeted a plant run by the DIPSA company in the city of Monterrey. It handles work for the Proceso news magazine as well as society and gossip publications. 
  
 The official said no one was injured in the Tuesday attack, but five employees had their cell phones and wallets taken.

– Barack Obama is en route to South Africa just as Nelson Mandela looks en route to the hereafter (though his ex-wife says he's showing ""great improvement""). But Obama says he won't push too hard to see the ailing luminary, for fear of being an unwanted complication. ""We'll see what the situation is when we land,"" Obama said while on Air Force One, the AFP reports. ""I do not need a photo op. ... I think that the message we'll want to deliver is not directly to him but to his family, is simply profound gratitude for his leadership all these years."" Don't take that as indifference; Obama considers Mandela a major inspiration, and says he got into politics via the anti-apartheid movement, the New York Times reports. When Oprah Winfrey offered to convey a message from the then-senator to Mandela in 2005, Obama spent so long writing it that Robert Gibbs had to go check on him. ""I can't just wing a note to Nelson Mandela,"" Obama protested. Obama eventually met Mandela later that year, in a chance meeting in Washington—and it remains their only face-to-face encounter.
","Let's expand this into a news article: Mr. Mandela has long been a beacon for Mr. Obama, who recounted again on Thursday how the revolution unleashed by Mr. Mandela a world away had inspired his own activism. Friends of Mr. Obama say that for him and many of his contemporaries, the fight against apartheid was the equivalent of the civil rights movement of an earlier generation. 
  
 “My first act of political activism was when I was at Occidental College,” Mr. Obama said Thursday at a news conference here in Dakar, referring to a brief speech he gave at the time. “I got involved in the anti-apartheid movement back in 1979-80 because I was inspired by what was taking place in South Africa.” 
  
 Recalling Mr. Mandela’s long imprisonment, Mr. Obama said, “I didn’t necessarily imagine that Nelson Mandela might be released.” 
  
 Mr. Obama rarely dwells on his own strides against racial barriers and has for the most part steered away from invoking Mr. Mandela’s struggles in public or in private. Aides say he considers it presumptuous to compare his own life to that of Mr. Mandela, who was imprisoned for 27 years, part of that time in a tiny cell on Robben Island, before forging an end to apartheid and becoming South Africa’s first black leader.

 But Mr. Obama’s closest advisers say people do not realize how much Mr. Mandela has been an inspiration to Mr. Obama in some of the president’s most difficult moments. Valerie B. Jarrett, a senior adviser and close friend of Mr. Obama’s, said Mr. Mandela had given Mr. Obama “the strength to persevere.” 
  
 In the foreword that Mr. Obama wrote to Mr. Mandela’s 2010 book, “Conversations With Myself,” he describes the early impact that Mr. Mandela’s struggle had on his life and his entry into politics. 
  
 “His sacrifice was so great that it called upon people everywhere to do what they could on behalf of human progress,” Mr. Obama wrote. “In the most modest of ways, I was one of those people who tried to answer his call.”

 Mr. Obama hinted in the foreword at what might be his most important lesson from Mr. Mandela’s struggles, the need to be stubborn in the face of obstacles. Like Mr. Mandela, who angered some black South Africans who wanted a more radical reordering of the country’s wealth, Mr. Obama has sometimes disillusioned his most ardent supporters. 
  
 Mr. Obama’s embrace of some of his predecessor’s antiterrorism policies has frustrated liberals. Revelations about secret surveillance programs have prompted concerns about privacy. And frequent budget clashes with Congress have left those who expected a new tone in Washington disillusioned. 
  
 “All of us face days when it can seem like change is hard — days when our opposition and our own imperfections may tempt us to take an easier path that avoids our responsibilities to one another,” Mr. Obama wrote in the foreword. “But even when little sunlight shined into that Robben Island cell, he could see a better future — one worthy of sacrifice.”

 In 2006, Mr. Obama stood inside that cell during a visit to South Africa as a senator. After the tour, Mr. Gibbs remembered Mr. Obama as quiet and somber. 
  
 “You could see it immediately on his face,” said Mr. Gibbs, who was with Mr. Obama on the trip. “It is almost impossible to comprehend spending that amount of your time imprisoned and in the conditions he was. Nobody really had to say anything. You felt the gravity of history literally on your shoulders.” 
  
 During that trip, Mr. Obama did not meet with Mr. Mandela, who was out of the country at the time. The two have met in person only once, in a spontaneous encounter in Washington in 2005, when Mr. Mandela was in town and was urged by advisers to take a few minutes to meet a rising Democratic senator named Barack Obama. 
  
 Video 
  
 Mr. Obama was in a car, on the way to a meeting, but diverted to the Four Seasons hotel in Georgetown, where Mr. Mandela was staying. The conversation produced a lasting image of Mr. Obama, in silhouette, standing next to a reclining Mr. Mandela. 
  
 David Katz, Mr. Obama’s driver and personal aide at the time, took the photo, a copy of which now sits in Mr. Mandela’s foundation office. Another copy is on Mr. Obama’s desk in the Oval Office. 
  
 “He was subdued and reflective and honored to have met a man like Nelson Mandela,” Mr. Katz recalled of the young senator’s demeanor after the five-minute exchange. “He was processing the experience, processing the history.”

 Mr. Mandela, who was already a retired statesman at the time, expressed admiration for Mr. Obama after meeting him, said his granddaughter Tukwini Mandela. “He thought that President Obama was a very intelligent young man and that he liked him very much,” she said in an e-mail. 
  
 Mr. Obama’s engagement in Mr. Mandela’s history began with the speech while he was a student at Occidental College in Los Angeles, where he urged the board of trustees to divest the college of South African investments as a protest against the country’s apartheid policies. At the time, Mr. Mandela was nearing the end of his second decade in prison. 
  
 In his brief remarks, Mr. Obama told the crowd that although South Africa’s racial struggles were “happening an ocean away,” it was “a struggle that touches each and every one of us.” 
  
 In the few instances since then that Mr. Obama has mentioned Mr. Mandela publicly, it has usually been in conjunction with other renowned leaders. When Mr. Obama accepted the Nobel Peace Prize in 2009, he said, “Compared to some of the giants of history who’ve received this prize — Schweitzer and King, Marshall and Mandela — my accomplishments are slight.” 
  
 In a separate interview with Russian television that year, Mr. Obama was asked about his heroes. 
  
 “Internationally, Nelson Mandela, Mahatma Gandhi,” Mr. Obama said. “I always am interested in leaders who are able to bring about transformative change without resort to violence, but rather changing people’s minds and people’s hearts.” 
  
 Aides said Mr. Obama identified with Mr. Mandela’s willingness to work, pragmatically and without anger or emotion, alongside those who had imprisoned him for so many years. 
  
 “The discipline, foresight, endurance — it all really struck a chord,” said Mark Lippert, a longtime foreign policy aide to Mr. Obama who now serves as the chief of staff to Chuck Hagel, the secretary of defense. “He admired Mandela’s ability to rise above it.” ||||| Obama says no need for 'photo op' with Mandela 
  
 (AFP) – Jun 28, 2013 
  
 ABOARD AIR FORCE ONE, Senegal — US President Barack Obama said Friday he would not press for a much-awaited meeting with his critically ill hero Nelson Mandela, hours before he landed in South Africa. 
  
 ""We'll see what the situation is when we land. I do not need a photo op,"" Obama said en route to the country, where he will spend the three days as part of a three-nation Africa trip. 
  
 ""The last thing I want to do is to be in any way obtrusive at a time when the family is concerned about Nelson Mandela's condition."" 
  
 Mandela, who turns 95 next month, was rushed to hospital three weeks ago with a recurring lung disease. 
  
 His condition is said to be critical, although the presidency says there have been some signs of improvements in recent days. 
  
 Mandela's ill health means the two men, who shattered racial boundaries on either side of the Atlantic, will not hold a long-anticipated meeting for the cameras. 
  
 ""I think that the message we'll want to deliver is not directly to him but to his family, is simply profound gratitude for his leadership all these years,"" Obama said. 
  
 Obama said he wanted to let Mandela's family know ""that the thoughts and prayers of the American people are with him and his family and his country"". 
  
 Reflections on Mandela's extraordinary journey from prisoner to president will permeate Obama's stay, but would not change the message of his trip. 
  
 ""The lesson will be consistent because it draws on the lessons of Nelson Mandela's own life.""

newsroom:1.0.0,183418,"Q: Snowden Says He Was Spy, Not Just an N.S.A. Analyst

Edward J. Snowden, the former National Security Agency contractor who leaked classified documents, said he was “trained as a spy” in his first interview with an American television network.

WASHINGTON — Edward J. Snowden said he was not merely a “low-level analyst” writing computer code for American spies, as President Obama and other administration officials have portrayed him. Instead, he said, he was a trained spy who worked under assumed names overseas for the Central Intelligence Agency and the National Security Agency.

Mr. Snowden’s claims were made in a television interview to be broadcast Wednesday evening by NBC News. They added a new twist to the yearlong public relations battle between the administration and Mr. Snowden, who is living under asylum in Moscow to escape prosecution for leaking thousands of classified files detailing extensive American surveillance programs at home and abroad.

“I was trained as a spy in sort of the traditional sense of the word in that I lived and worked undercover overseas — pretending to work in a job that I’m not — and even being assigned a name that was not mine,” Mr. Snowden told Brian Williams of NBC News, in an excerpt released in advance of the full interview.

The N.S.A., which has described Mr. Snowden as an information technology contractor, has not commented on the new claims. But Secretary of State John Kerry, in a CBS News interview on Wednesday, suggested that Mr. Snowden’s refusal to return to the United States amounted to cowardice.

“The bottom line is this is a man who has betrayed his country, who is sitting in Russia, an authoritarian country, where he has taken refuge,” he said. “He should man up and come back to the United States if he has a complaint about what’s the matter with American surveillance, come back here and stand in our system of justice and make his case. But instead he is just sitting there taking potshots at his country, violating his oath that he took when he took on the job he took.”

Mr. Snowden suggested that the government was deliberately playing down his role as a spy.

“They’re trying to use one position that I’ve had in a career here or there to distract from the totality of my experience,” he said.

Mr. Snowden said, however, that he had not been the kind of spy depicted by Hollywood who embeds himself in glamorous overseas locations to extract information through interpersonal connections.

“I am a technical specialist,” he said. “I am a technical expert. I don’t work with people. I don’t recruit agents. What I do is I put systems to work for the United States. And I’ve done that at all levels from — from the bottom on the ground all the way to the top. Now, the government might deny these things, they might frame it in certain ways and say, ‘Oh well, you know, he’s a low-level analyst.’ ”

According to government officials and former colleagues, Mr. Snowden first went to work as a security guard at an N.S.A.-financed language research center at the University of Maryland. His computer skills evidently attracted attention, and he subsequently worked overseas for the C.I.A. in Geneva and for N.S.A. contractors in Japan, Maryland and Hawaii before flying to Hong Kong last year and handing secret N.S.A. documents to several journalists.

According to his résumé and interviews, he worked in cyber-counterintelligence, searching classified government computer systems looking for intrusions from hackers and foreign spies. In his last job in Hawaii, he was described as an “infrastructure analyst,” which former N.S.A. officials say probably meant that he was looking for vulnerabilities in foreign telephone and Internet systems that would allow the agency to tap in.

Q: Ukraine to lobby Kerry for arms

Rocket fire has killed five people near a hospital in Ukraine. (AAP)

US Secretary of State John Kerry has arrived in Kiev where pro-Western leaders hope Washington will send weapons to help them battle pro-Russian separatists.

His visit on Thursday comes as international pressure grows for an immediate halt to the surging violence in eastern Ukraine, with 19 civilians and troops killed in the latest rebel push into government-held territory.

In Brussels, NATO was set to agree a major boost to the alliance's defences near its Russian borders, including a quick-reaction spearhead force of 5000 troops.

Despite growing talk of Washington arming Ukrainian forces, a State Department official said only that Kerry would unveil $US16 million ($A20.57 million) in US humanitarian aid.

Kerry will meet President Petro Poroshenko, Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk and Foreign Minister Pavlo Klimkin ahead of a security conference in Munich on Friday during which he will sit down with Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov.

""We have a Russian government talking the talk of ceasefire, talking the talk of peace, even as it fuels this conflict,"" a senior State Department official said.

Ukraine and its Western allies accuse Moscow of sending thousands of regular army troops and weapons to support the rebels who launched an uprising against Kiev in April.

And while Moscow has repeatedly denied the allegations, the separatists are equipped with the advanced weaponry of a regular army.

The fighting has claimed more than 5350 lives since April, including 220 in the past three weeks.

President Barack Obama's nominee for defence secretary Ashton Carter said on Wednesday he was likely to support providing weapons.

In a move is likely to irk Moscow, NATO will also decide on six ""command and control"" units in Eastern European nations to ensure the new quick reaction force hits the ground running.

newsroom:1.0.0,160712,"Q:
Donald Trump Was AIPAC’s Bad Prom King
Crowds rarely have integrity. For all the reservations people expressed about Donald Trump before he arrived to speak at the American Israel Public Affairs Committee’s annual policy conference—the misogynistic posturing, the crudeness of public statements about various groups, the vacuity of his public pronouncements on policy—all it took was a few assurances about Israel to have people on their feet. Not that the crowd should have been rude. To treat a guest politely is appropriate.

The much-publicized Rabbi walkout was a mistake—you do not invite someone to your house and then turn your back on them. But the deeper question is how does one behave when a candidate says, “I’m not here to pander” as Trump did, before saying everything he knows the crowd wishes to hear? Manners do not mandate agreement. Applause, like tipping, is not an obligation but a gratuity.

As I sat and kept my hands still, I did warm to the content of certain things Trump said. But a political message is not a mathematical formula, independent of the one who declares its validity. Political messages are tied to the messenger. Sitting in the vast auditorium and speaking to people afterwards, three observations occurred about the nature and content of Trump’s talk.

1. He didn’t speak off the cuff. He read from a Teleprompter, a device he has mocked other politicians for using, even saying that one who runs for President shouldn’t be allowed to use them. The prompter served him well, however. As a result of that and some preparation, his address had far more content than previous talks. He spoke cogently about Hamas and Hezbollah, about the threat of Iran and the Israel-America relationship. The speech did not approach the level of foreign policy sophistication of Hillary Clinton’s talk in the morning, but certainly surprised those who believed it would be a trail of smoke and bluster. That he is able to absorb and communicate policy particulars is clear.

2. When he did improvise, he wandered into the thicket of self-reverence. His claim to have studied the Iran deal “in more detail than anyone else” was met with a smattering of derisive laughter. He doubled down, insisting that he had, thereby shocking experts in Israel, America and elsewhere, as well as academics and others sitting in the hall, a number of whom have devoted their lives to nuclear studies or Iranian studies or both. His boast about being the Grand Marshal for an Israeli Day parade did not strike the people I spoke with as a serious credential. The election isn’t for prom king.

3. He didn’t address many important issues. Trump’s speech did not address anything beyond the confines of the Israel-American relationship. The larger questions of the Middle East, or immigration in the U.S. or Europe, were left mostly untouched. In that sense this was a careful speech. The Jewish philosopher Hermann Cohen said that in the idea of the stranger Judaism was born. Indeed before he spoke there was a presentation of what Israel has done to help Syrian refugees. Trump was speaking to a crowd sensitive to the idea of the stranger, the dispossessed, those desperate for hope. Evading the issue was a wise strategy. A retread of xenophobia would have ruined the effect.

Walking back to the hotel afterwards I asked one young woman what she thought. “Well, it was exciting and that’s all that matters,” she said. Yes, it is all that matters if your goal is to be entertained. But a voter is not a fan, and a candidate is not a celebrity. The stakes are as high as they could be. Neither resentment nor enchantment are adequate to decide—there has to be thought, testing, understanding.

I left the conference thinking about the words of Rabban Gamliel two thousand years ago. He declared that no one should be admitted to the house of study whose inside is not like his outside. I wondered who among the candidates would have passed the Rabbi’s exacting test. And who, clearly, would not.

6. The perception of women as on the side-lines is so ingrained that most womens sport teams do not have a cheer squad and in several high schools in the US , cheerleaders have been uncomfortable when asked to cheer for girls sports teams .

Critic consensus:Though it deviates from Stephen King's novel, Stanley Kubrick's The Shining is a chilling, often baroque journey into madness -- exemplified by an unforgettable turn from Jack Nicholson

Numbered reviews:","1. Among a handful of the scariest movies ever made.

3. Re-cut or not, The Shining remains one of the most viscerally disturbing films ever made.

2. It covers some serious topics about adolescence, but it does it with a wink and a knowing nod; some things that are tragic when you're 14 are quite funny in hindsight.
3. This zany comedy written and directed by Tamara Jenkins is filled with humorous takes on sexuality in the 1970s.
4. Ultimately it's all a bit predictable -- the cyclical story more or less ends where it begins -- but it's nevertheless a charming and delightful romp, with keen observations about character, time and place.
5. What lifts this brash comedy above the vulgar herd is Tamara Jenkins in a heartfelt feature debut as writer and director.
6. It's hard for me to sympathize with people I don't like, and except for Lyonne's character I didn't like anyone in the story.

OUT: 1. Watching Raiders of the Lost Ark again on the big screen I was again reminded how summer films were once thoroughly entertaining and fulfilling.
2. Spielberg's and Lucas's collaborative rip-roaring adventure story with a hero of epic proportions makes this film one of the best screen entertainments of 1981.
3. Raiders of the Lost Ark is a wonderful movie. The good news for exhibitors is that it's also one of those rollercoaster-like movies that people will be lining up for again and again.
4. With an unforgettable opening sequence in which our hero flees through a trap-filled tunnel from a great ball of rock, Raiders Of The Lost Ark is a film which wastes no time and never lets go of our attention.
5. George Lucas and Steven Spielberg's classic movie did not invent adventure, as it was largely inspired by old serials, pulp magazines and B-movies, but it certainly revamped our conception of big screen adventure.
6. One of the all-time great films.
7. This film was also not only the subject of my very first movie review, but also the reason why I started reading movie reviews in newspapers and paying attention what the critics actually think about movies.
8. Raiders Of The Lost Ark was the first in the Indiana Jones trilogy, and it can be argued that it changed the course of filmmaking for the better part of a decade.
9. Astounding movie packed with non-stop action, stunts galore, an interesting story line, great one-liners, a solid cast, a catchy musical score, and all the fun and adventure that you could squeeze into a two-hour thrill ride.
10. The purpose of the exercise. If you can't love this film, you have no business loving movies at all.

4. The spectacular fire sequences, which must have been hellish to film, are powerfully enveloping on screen, thanks especially to the eerie effect of the title.
5. Mocked by some, for reasons I can't fathom, I find it to be Howard's strongest film. Excellent cast.

quac:1.0.0,148942,"Background: ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" is a song by the British rock band Queen. It was written by Freddie Mercury for the band's 1975 album A Night at the Opera. It is a six-minute suite, consisting of several sections without a chorus: an intro, a ballad segment, an operatic passage, a hard rock part and a reflective coda. The song is a more accessible take on the 1970s progressive rock genre.
Context: I'm going to shatter some illusions, it was just one of those pieces I wrote for the album: just writing my batch of songs. In its early stages I almost rejected it, but then it grew. We started deciding on a single about halfway through. There were a few contenders - we were thinking of ""The Prophet's Song"" at one point - but then ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" seemed the one. There was a time when the others wanted to chop it around a bit, but I refused. If it was going to be released, it would be in its entirety. We knew it was very risky, but we had so much confidence in that song - I did anyway. I felt, underneath it all, that if it was successful it would earn a lot of respect. People were all going, You're joking, they'll never play it, you'll only hear the first few bars and then they'll fade it out. We had numerous rows. EMI were shocked - a six-minute single? You must be joking! The same in America - oh, you just got away with it in Britain.  When we finished the album, the Night at the Opera album, that was the track on it that we thought we were gonna release as a single in the UK first. And when we released it in Britain we didn't necessarily think it'd be released in America, cause we know even over here, you know, the AM tastes are even more [hesitates] stricter. Anyway we did have thoughts about even in the UK, perhaps editing it down at all, but we listened to it over and over again and there was no way we could edit it. We tried a few ideas, but if you edited it, you always lost some part of the song, so we had to leave it all in. And luckily it took off anyway.  The vocal harmonies was something we wanted to do from the beginning, as we are always keen to do that kind of thing. We wanted to be a group that could do the heaviness of hard rock, but also have harmonies swooping around all over the place. We thought there was some real power and emotion in that combination. The guitar solo was pretty much off the cuff, except I think I had plenty of time to think about that one. I remember playing along with it in the studio for a while when other things were being done. I knew what kind of melody I wanted to play.

Answer: 

Background: The Sweet (also known as Sweet) is a British glam rock band that rose to worldwide fame in the 1970s. Their best known line-up consisted of lead vocalist Brian Connolly, bass player Steve Priest, guitarist Andy Scott, and drummer Mick Tucker. The group was originally called Sweetshop. The band was formed in London in 1968 and achieved their first hit, ""Funny Funny"", in 1971 after teaming up with songwriters Nicky Chinn and Mike Chapman and record producer Phil Wainman.
Context: The Sweet made their UK television debut in December 1970 on a pop show called Lift Off, performing the song ""Funny Funny"". A management deal was signed with the aforementioned songwriting team of Nicky Chinn and Mike Chapman. Phil Wainman resumed his collaboration with Sweet, as executive producer. This management deal also included a worldwide (the U.S. excepted) record contract with RCA Records (in the United States and Canada Bell Records issued the group's music until late 1973; followed by Capitol Records).  In March 1971 RCA issued ""Funny Funny"", written by Chinn and Chapman, which became the group's first international hit, climbing to the Top 20 on many of the world's charts. EMI reissued their 1970 single ""All You'll Ever Get from Me"" (May 1971) and it again failed to chart. Their next RCA release ""Co-Co"" (June 1971) went to number two in the U.K. and their follow up single, ""Alexander Graham Bell"" (October 1971), only went to #33. These tracks still featured session musicians on the instruments with the quartet providing only the vocals.  The Sweet's first full LP album, Funny How Sweet Co-Co Can Be, was released in November 1971. A collection of the band's recent singles supplemented by some new Chinn/Chapman tunes (including ""Chop Chop"" and ""Tom Tom Turnaround"") and pop covers (such as the Lovin' Spoonful's ""Daydream"" and the Supremes' ""Reflections""), the album, recorded at Nova Studios in London, was produced by Phil Wainman and engineered by Richard Dodd and Eric Holland. It was not a serious contender on the charts. Their albums' failure to match the success of their singles was a problem that would plague the band throughout their career.

quac:1.0.0,23338,"Some context: Saint Pedro Calungsod (Latin: Petrus Calungsod, Spanish: Pedro Calungsod or archaically Pedro Calonsor, Italian: Pietro Calungsod; July 21, 1654 - April 2, 1672), also known as Peter Calungsod and Pedro Calonsor, was a Roman Catholic Filipino migrant, sacristan and missionary catechist who, along with the Spanish Jesuit missionary Diego Luis de San Vitores, suffered religious persecution and martyrdom in Guam for their missionary work in 1672. While in Guam, Calungsod preached Christianity to the Chamorro people through catechism, while baptizing infants, children and adults at the risk and expense of being persecuted and eventually murdered.
Few details of the early life of Calungsod (spelled Calonsor in Spanish records) are known. Historical records do not mention his exact birthplace or birth date and merely identified him as ""Pedro Calonsor, el Visayo"". Historical research identifies Ginatilan in Cebu, Hinunangan and Hinundayan in Southern Leyte, and the Molo district of Iloilo City as possible places of origin; Loboc, Bohol also makes a claim. Of these claims, the ones from Molo, Iloilo and Ginatilan, Cebu are considered the strongest.  Proponents of an Ilonggo origin argue that in the early Spanish period, the term ""Visayan"" exclusively referred to people from the islands of Negros or Panay, whereas people from Cebu, Bohol and Leyte were called ""Pintados"". Thus, had he been born in Cebu he would have been referred to as ""Calonsor El Pintado"" instead of ""Calonsor El Visayo""; the term ""Visayan"" received its present scope (i.e., including inhabitants of Cebu, Bohol and Leyte) sometime the 1700s. However, American historian and scholar John N. Schumacher, S.J. disputes the Bisaya/Pintados dichotomy claim as at that time the Pintados were also referred to as Visayans regardless of location and said Pedro ""was a Visayan"" and may have been but doubtfully ""from the island of Cebu"" or ""could have come any other Visayas islands.""  The Cebu camp reasoned that Ginatilan contains the highest concentrations of people surnamed Calungsod and that during the beatification process, they were the original claimants to having been Calungsod's birthplace. The Calungsod family in Iloilo also claims to be the oldest branch, based on baptismal records containing the surname ""Calungsod"" dating to circa 1748, compared to branches in Cebu and Leyte who possess baptismal records dating only to 1828 and 1903. Regardless of his precise origin, all four locations were within the territory of the Diocese of Cebu at the time of Calungsod's martyrdom.

A: Calungsod and that during the beatification process, they were the original claimants to having been Calungsod's birthplace.
Some context: Lilyan Tashman (October 23, 1896 - March 21, 1934) was an American vaudeville, Broadway, and film actress. Tashman was best known for her supporting roles as tongue-in-cheek villainesses and the vindictive ""other woman."" She made 66 films over the course of her Hollywood career and although she never obtained superstar status, her cinematic performances are described as ""sharp, clever and have aged little over the decades."" Tall, blonde, and slender with fox-like features and a throaty voice, Tashman freelanced as a fashion and artist's model in New York City.
Lilyan Tashman's entertainment career began in vaudeville, and by 1914 she was an experienced performer, appearing in Song Revue in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, with rising stars Eddie Cantor and Al Lee. In 1916, she played Viola in a Shakespeare-inspired number for the Ziegfeld Follies and remained with the Follies for the 1917 and 1918 seasons. In 1919, producer David Belasco gave her a supporting role in Avery Hopwood's comedy The Gold Diggers. The show ran two years with Tashman acting as an understudy, and occasionally filling in, for star Ina Claire.  In 1921, Tashman made her film debut playing Pleasure in an allegorical segment of Experience, and when The Gold Diggers closed she appeared in the plays The Garden of Weeds and Madame Pierre. In 1922, she had a small role in the Mabel Normand film Head Over Heels. Her personal and professional lives in 1922 were not entirely satisfactory (best friend Edmund Lowe moved to Hollywood, for example, and she was fired from Madame Pierre) so she relocated to California and quickly found work in films. In 1924, she appeared in five films (including a cinematic adaptation of The Garden of Weeds) and received good reviews for Nellie, the Beautiful Cloak Model and Winner Take All. She freelanced, moving from studio to studio, but signed a long-term contract in 1931 with Paramount. She made nine films for the studio.  In 1925, she appeared in 10 films, including Pretty Ladies with Joan Crawford and Myrna Loy. From 1926 to 1929, she appeared in numerous films, became a valued supporting player, and starred in the independent Rocking Moon (1926) and The Woman Who Did Not Care (1927). She played supporting roles in Ernst Lubitsch's farce So This Is Paris (1926), Camille with Norma Talmadge (1926), A Texas Steer with Will Rogers (1927), director Dorothy Arzner's Manhattan Cocktail (1928), and Hardboiled (1929). Her Variety reviews were good.  She easily managed the transition to sound films, making a total of 28, and appeared in some of the very first, including United Artists's Bulldog Drummond (1929), The Trial of Mary Dugan (1929), the now-lost color musical Gold Diggers of Broadway (1929), and New York Nights (1930) with Norma Talmadge. She starred as a murderess in the melodrama Murder by the Clock, as a self-sacrificing mother in The Road to Reno (1931), and as a chorus girl in Wine, Women and Song (1933). In 1932, her health began to fail but she appeared in The Wiser Sex, Those We Love, the film on the Russian Revolution, Scarlet Dawn, Mama Loves Papa with Charlie Ruggles (1933), and the musical Too Much Harmony (1933). In early 1934, she appeared in Riptide with Norma Shearer. Her last film, Frankie and Johnny, was released posthumously in 1936. Director George Cukor described Tashman as ""a very diverting creature [...] outrageous and cheerful and goodhearted.""

The professionals soon displaced the amateur ex-Public schoolboys. Bermuda's role as the primary Royal Navy base in the Western Hemisphere, with an army garrison to match, ensured that the naval and military officers quickly introduced the newly formalised sports to Bermuda, including cricket, football, Rugby football, and even tennis and rowing (rowing did not adapt well from British rivers to the stormy Atlantic. The officers soon switched to sail racing, founding the Royal Bermuda Yacht Club). Once these sports reached Bermuda, they were eagerly adopted by Bermudians.

Input: Buddhism
Buddhist schools vary on the exact nature of the path to liberation, the importance and canonicity of various teachings and scriptures, and especially their respective practices. Buddhism denies a creator deity and posits that mundane deities such as Mahabrahma are misperceived to be a creator. The foundations of Buddhist tradition and practice are the Three Jewels: the Buddha, the Dharma (the teachings), and the Sangha (the community). Taking ""refuge in the triple gem"" has traditionally been a declaration and commitment to being on the Buddhist path, and in general distinguishes a Buddhist from a non-Buddhist. Other practices are Ten Meritorious Deeds including, giving charity to reduce the greediness; following ethical precepts; renouncing conventional living and becoming a monastic; the development of mindfulness and practice of meditation; cultivation of higher wisdom and discernment; study of scriptures; devotional practices; ceremonies; and in the Mahayana tradition, invocation of buddhas and bodhisattvas.

Other important Venetian mosaics can be found in the Cathedral of Santa Maria Assunta in Torcello from the 12th century, and in the Basilical of Santi Maria e Donato in Murano with a restored apse mosaic from the 12th century and a beautiful mosaic pavement (1140). The apse of the San Cipriano Church in Murano was decorated with an impressive golden mosaic from the early 13th century showing Christ enthroned with Mary, St John and the two patron saints, Cipriano and Cipriana. When the church was demolished in the 19th century, the mosaic was bought by Frederick William IV of Prussia. It was reassembled in the Friedenskirche of Potsdam in the 1840s.

Here is a question about this article: Island genetics provides one proposed explanation for the sudden, fully developed appearance of flowering plants. Island genetics is believed to be a common source of speciation in general, especially when it comes to radical adaptations that seem to have required inferior transitional forms. Flowering plants may have evolved in an isolated setting like an island or island chain, where the plants bearing them were able to develop a highly specialized relationship with some specific animal (a wasp, for example). Such a relationship, with a hypothetical wasp carrying pollen from one plant to another much the way fig wasps do today, could result in the development of a high degree of specialization in both the plant(s) and their partners. Note that the wasp example is not incidental; bees, which, it is postulated, evolved specifically due to mutualistic plant relationships, are descended from wasps.

Artists such as Paul Gauguin, Henri Matisse, and Pablo Picasso were intrigued and inspired by the stark power and simplicity of styles of those foreign cultures. Around 1906, Picasso met Matisse through Gertrude Stein, at a time when both artists had recently acquired an interest in primitivism, Iberian sculpture, African art and African tribal masks. They became friendly rivals and competed with each other throughout their careers, perhaps leading to Picasso entering a new period in his work by 1907, marked by the influence of Greek, Iberian and African art. Picasso's paintings of 1907 have been characterized as Protocubism, as notably seen in Les Demoiselles d'Avignon, the antecedent of Cubism.

QUES: In the early 19th century, the Indigenous American woman Sacagawea, who would help translate for and guide the Lewis and Clark Expedition in the West, married the French trapper Toussaint Charbonneau. Most marriages between Europeans and Indigenous Americans were between European men and Indigenous American women. Depending on the kinship system of the woman's tribe, their children would be more or less easily assimilated into the tribe. Nations that had matrilineal systems, such as the Creek and Cherokee in the Southeast, gave the mixed-race children status in their mother's clans and tribes. If the tribe had a patrilineal system, like the Omaha, the children of white fathers were considered white. Unless they were specifically adopted into the tribe by an adult male, they could have no social status in it.
Who married Sacagewea?

Oleg set about consolidating his power over the surrounding region and the riverways north to Novgorod, imposing tribute on the East Slav tribes. In 883, he conquered the Drevlians, imposing a fur tribute on them. By 885 he had subjugated the Poliane, Severiane, Vyatichi, and Radimichs, forbidding them to pay further tribute to the Khazars.

QUES: Because of the distance of Neptune from Earth, its angular diameter only ranges from 2.2 to 2.4 arcseconds, the smallest of the Solar System planets. Its small apparent size makes it challenging to study it visually. Most telescopic data was fairly limited until the advent of Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and large ground-based telescopes with adaptive optics (AO). The first scientifically useful observation of Neptune from ground-based telescopes using adaptive optics, was commenced in 1997 from Hawaii. Neptune is currently entering its spring and summer season and has been shown to be heating up, with increased atmospheric activity and brightness as a consequence. Combined with technological advancements, ground-based telescopes with adaptive optics are recording increasingly more detailed images of this Outer Planet. Both the HST and AO telescopes on Earth has made many new discoveries within the Solar System since the mid-1990s, with a large increase in the number of known satellites and moons around the Outer Planets for example.

Question:
American Airlines Flight 11: FAA Awareness. Although the Boston Center air traffic controller realized at an early stage that there was something wrong with American 11, he did not immediately interpret the plane's failure to respond as a sign that it had been hijacked. At 8:14, when the flight failed to heed his instruction to climb to 35,000 feet, the controller repeatedly tried to raise the flight. He reached out to the pilot on the emergency frequency. Though there was no response, he kept trying to contact the aircraft. At 8:21, American 11 turned off its transponder, immediately degrading the information available about the aircraft. The controller told his supervisor that he thought something was seriously wrong with the plane, although neither suspected a hijacking. The supervisor instructed the controller to follow standard procedures for handling a ""no radio"" aircraft. The controller checked to see if American Airlines could establish communication with American 11. He became even more concerned as its route changed, moving into another sector's airspace. Controllers immediately began to move aircraft out of its path, and asked other aircraft in the vicinity to look for American 11. At 8:24:38, the following transmission came from American 11: American 11: We have some planes. Just stay quiet, and you'll be okay. We are returning to the airport. The controller only heard something unintelligible; he did not hear the specific words ""we have some planes."" The next transmission came seconds later: American 11: Nobody move.

Question:
Expansion quickly peaked however, and the European powers who had carved up the New World set about testing each other in dynastic conflicts and colonial rivalry. The English were the main rivals of the Dutch on the high seas, and there were several wars between the two in the 17th and 18th centuries. In 1665–1667 the Dutch sailed up the River Medway and sank the British fleet moored there. The 18th century saw Amsterdam grow into the foremost financial center in the world, but the seeds of decline had already been planted. When the English colonies in New England rose up in revolt against the British, they found ready Ailies in the Dutch. From their colonies in the Caribbean they sent caches of arms and ammunition. The British were furious and went to war in 1780, destroying the Dutch navy and signaling a sudden decline in power and influence from which the Netherlands never recovered. Trade suffered to such an extent that in 1791 the VOC went into liquidation. In the latter part of the century there were anti-Orange demonstrations by pro-French factions in the country, and in 1795 Napoleon Bonaparte took the Netherlands in his epic march across Europe. Under the yoke of another foreign power, and with trade at an all time low, the Golden Age was truly dead. The Return of the House of Orange Napoleon installed his brother Louis as King of Holland and he chose to take the fine Town Hall on Dam Square as his palace — now the Koninklijk Palace. But only four years later he fled the city after civil disturbances broke out when he raised taxes. When Napoleon's bubble burst and French power began to wane, William of Orange emerged from exile and was proclaimed king in 1813. Amsterdam had to work its way out of economic decline, but throughout the 19th century the city grew steadily. Industrialization changed the city. With the building of the Central Station at the end of the century, Amsterdam turned its back on its seafaring past and looked towards the mechanical age for its future. The station was built over the old harbor wall and some of the oldest canals in the city center were filled in to allow better access to motorized vehicles. Dam Square was landlocked for the first time in its history.  After reading the above, is ""England and the United States"" the correct answer to the question ""Which countries did the Netherlands have problems with?""?

Question:
""Femme"" is an apt description of the depiction of Madame White Snake and all her incarnations. It refers to a woman who is dangerously attractive, and lures men to their downfall with her sexual attractiveness. In both incarnations of Madame White snake, the authors depict her as bewitchingly beautiful. Toyoo, her human lover in ""Lust of the White Serpant"" cannot shake the image of her beauty from his mind and dreams of her, and finds himself ""disturbed and agitated"" by her ""ethereal beauty"". In ""Eternal Prisoner,"" Madame White Snake's bewitching beauty follows her lover Hsü into his dreams, and the next morning ""he was so distracted that he could not concentrate on doing business."" Both of these stories align negative connotations with her beauty, suggesting that her sexuality is the cause of their distraction. In addition to distracting sexuality, the irregular characterization of Madame White Snake might be another trait her character has in common with the archetypical noir femme fatale. In her essay analyzing the noir film from a feminist perspective, Christine Gledhill writes ""Not only is the hero frequently not sure whether the woman is honest or a deceiver, but the heroine's characterisation is itself fractured so that it is not evident to the audience whether she fills the [femme fatale] stereotype or not"".

Input: After the 1998 embassy bombings, the U.S. government tried to develop a clearer picture of  Bin Laden's finances. A U.S. interagency group traveled to Saudi Arabia twice, in 1999 and 2000, to get information from the Saudis about their understanding of those finances. The group eventually concluded that the oft-repeated assertion that  Bin Laden was funding al Qaeda from his personal fortune was in fact not true. The officials developed a new theory: al Qaeda was getting its money elsewhere, and the United States needed to focus on other sources of funding, such as charities, wealthy donors, and financial facilitators. Ultimately, although the intelligence community devoted more resources to the issue and produced somewhat more intelligence, it remained difficult to distinguish al Qaeda's financial transactions among the vast sums moving in the international financial system. The CIA was not able to find or disrupt al Qaeda's money flows. The NSC staff thought that one possible solution to these weaknesses in the intelligence community was to create an all-source terrorist-financing intelligence analysis center. Clarke pushed for the funding of such a center at Treasury, but neither Treasury nor the CIA was willing to commit the resources. Within the United States, various FBI field offices gathered intelligence on organizations suspected of raising funds for al Qaeda or other terrorist groups. By 9/11, FBI agents understood that there were extremist organizations operating within the United States supporting a global jihadist movement and with substantial connections to al Qaeda. The FBI operated a web of informants, conducted electronic surveillance, and had opened significant investigations in a number of field offices, including New York, Chicago, Detroit, San Diego, and Minneapolis. On a national level, however, the FBI never used the information to gain a systematic or strategic understanding of the nature and extent of al Qaeda fundraising. Treasury regulators, as well as U.S. financial institutions, were generally focused on finding and deterring or disrupting the vast flows of U.S. currency generated by drug trafficking and high-level international fraud. Large-scale scandals, such as the use of the Bank of New York by Russian money launderers to move millions of dollars out of Russia, captured the attention of the Department of the Treasury and of Congress. Before 9/11, Treasury did not consider terrorist financing important enough to mention in its national strategy for money laundering.

Answer: By the time you have finished wandering around aimlessly in the MGM grand to find the monorail entrance, you coud've walked the strip and been at your destination faster.  Because of course if you follow the confusing signs, you just end up winding around all the casino tables which takes twice as long.   Just do yourself a favor and take the bus that runs up and down the strip all day....it's much cheaper.

Answer:",I was in the neighborhood and craving some healthy food...thank goodness I spy Pita Jungle. We shared the Spanakopita and while it's not a lot- it is under $4. My favorite was the feta cube that was served with it. YUM. Best feta... I want to buy it in bulk it's so light and delicious. We then shared the chicken shawarma  which was perfect and the grilled vegetable side which was a little too peppery- but still very good.

Answer: Disappointing.   Im going to start my review of Ming's Pagoda on a positive note.  The service at Ming's Pagoda was quick and the staff  was accomdating,  the food however was not good.   The egg drop soup was thick and lacked flavor and the wontons were stale and challenging to chew. On my first visit to Ming's Pagoda I had the lemon chicken. The lemon chicken was very disaponting. The coating was crunchy but the chicken was dry, not moist at all, and there was just to much lemon sauce placed over the chicken.  My lunch companion had the chicken lo mein.  The noodles were somewhat greasy and once again the chicken was dry. The fried rice, eggrolls, and fried wontons were equally disappointing.  Not the best restaurant experience.
